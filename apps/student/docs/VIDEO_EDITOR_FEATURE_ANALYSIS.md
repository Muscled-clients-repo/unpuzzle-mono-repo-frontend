2. **Video Thumbnails** - Clips show as colored blocks
3. **Effect Browser** - No way to browse/apply effects
4. **Properties Panel** - Exists but non-functional
5. **Asset Organization** - No media management
6. **Preview Rendering** - Can't preview with effects
7. **Zoom Timeline** - Critical for precise editing
8. **Clip Trimming** - No in/out point adjustment

## Feature Completion Score

| Category | Completion |
|----------|------------|
| Basic Editing | 80% |
| Audio Features | 30% |
| Visual Effects | 0% |
| Export/Render | 70% |
| Timeline Tools | 60% |
| Project Management | 70% |
| Professional Features | 10% |
| **Overall** | **40%** |

## Technical Limitations

1. **Performance**: No optimization for long videos or many clips
2. **Browser Limits**: Memory constraints for large projects
3. **Server Dependency**: Export requires server processing
4. **No GPU Acceleration**: All processing is CPU-based
5. **Limited Codec Support**: Depends on browser capabilities

## Recommendations for MVP

To reach a minimum viable product for basic video editing:

1. **Implement audio waveforms** (Critical)
2. **Add video thumbnails** (Critical)
3. **Complete razor tool** (High)
4. **Add basic transitions** (High)
5. **Implement timeline zoom** (High)
6. **Add volume controls** (Medium)
7. **Create effect presets** (Medium)
8. **Improve error handling** (Medium)

## Conclusion

The video editor has strong foundations in timeline management, AI voice generation, and basic editing. However, it currently functions more as a basic video arrangement tool rather than a full-featured editor. Priority should be given to implementing audio waveforms, video thumbnails, and completing the partially implemented features before adding advanced capabilities.
