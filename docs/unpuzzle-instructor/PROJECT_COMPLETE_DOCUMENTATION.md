## Project Overview

The Unpuzzle Instructor portal is a comprehensive educational platform featuring:
- Course management system
- Advanced video editor with AI voice generation
- Screen recording capabilities
- Video annotation system
- Analytics and progress tracking
- Payment integration with Stripe

## Major Tasks Completed

### 1. Video Editor Reorganization (July 2025)

**Purpose**: Improve code organization and maintainability

**Changes Made**:
- Moved video editor components from global `/app/components/` to page-specific `/app/instructor/video-editor/components/`
- Created proper folder structure with feature-based organization
- Updated all import paths (added additional `../` levels for context, redux, hooks, and utilities)
- Maintained all functionality while improving modularity

**New Structure**:
```
/app/instructor/video-editor/components/
├── VideoEditorScreen.tsx
├── RecordingIndicator.tsx
└── VideoEditor/
    ├── AIVoice/
    ├── Export/
    ├── Recording/
    ├── TextOverlay/
    ├── Timeline/
    ├── Transitions/
    ├── VideoEditorTabs/
    ├── VideoPlayer/
    └── [other components]
```

### 2. Component Cleanup (18 files removed)

**Priority Removals**:
- Duplicate files (`VideoScreen copy.tsx`, `VIdeoScreen.tsx` with typo)
- Obsolete authentication components (replaced by Clerk)
- Example/demo code not used in production
- Unused admin and dashboard components

**Benefits**:
- Reduced codebase complexity
- Eliminated duplicate code
- Improved build performance
- Better maintainability

### 3. Hooks & Contexts Cleanup (20 files removed)

**Removed Unused Hooks**:
- Meeting booking functionality
- User activity tracking
- AI agent integration
- Socket connections
- Stripe payment hooks (dependent on removed contexts)

**Removed Unused Contexts**:
- Non-functional class implementations in context folder
- Contexts without providers in app layout
- YouTube player context (unused)
- Payment and activity tracking contexts

**Import Path Fixes**:
- Corrected paths in instructor pages
- Fixed broken imports after cleanup

### 4. Video Editor Feature Analysis (July 23, 2025)

**Completed Features** (40% of professional editor capabilities):
- Multi-track timeline (video, audio, AI voice, music)
- AI voice generation with multiple providers
- Screen recording with quality options
- Text overlay editor with full customization
- Export functionality with multiple formats
- Keyboard shortcuts system
- Project auto-save
- Snapping system with alignment guides

**Partially Completed**:
- Transitions (30% - UI only, no rendering)
- Timeline editing tools (60% - razor tool incomplete)
- Audio management (40% - no volume controls)
- Media library (50% - depends on external API)
- Undo/redo (70% - no UI visualization)

**Not Implemented**:
- Visual effects and filters
- Audio waveforms and mixing
- Video thumbnails in timeline
- Keyframe animation
- Multi-layer compositing
- Professional color grading

### 5. Snapping Functionality Investigation (July 23, 2025)

**Findings**:
- All snapping components properly implemented
- Feature requires video content to be visible
- Includes magnetic snap, visual guides, and markers
- Keyboard shortcut (Alt+S) functional
- Redux state management working correctly

**Technical Details**:
- Snap threshold: 0.5 seconds / 10 pixels
- Alignment guides with color coding
- Overlap prevention during positioning
- Custom timeline markers support

### 6. Build Error Analysis

**Identified Issues** (114 TypeScript errors):
- Missing dependencies (socket.io-client, date-fns)
- Type definition mismatches
- String/number assignment errors
- Missing properties in interfaces
- Import/export mismatches

**Critical Fixes Needed**:
1. Install missing packages
2. Update type definitions for Course, Video, Asset, AiFile
3. Fix Redux action dispatches
4. Add missing state variables
5. Correct useRef implementations

## Video Editor Development

### Core Components

**Timeline System**:
- `TimelineContainer.tsx` - Main timeline rendering
- `VideoTrackWithSnapping.tsx` - Drag-and-drop with snapping
- `ClipEditorFixed.tsx` - Clip manipulation
- `SnappingControls.tsx` - Snapping toggles and settings

**AI Voice Integration**:
- `ScriptEditor.tsx` - Text input for TTS
- `AiVoicesPopover.tsx` - Voice selection
- `AiWaveSurferBox.tsx` - Audio waveform display
- Integration with ElevenLabs and OpenAI

**Recording System**:
