## Import Path Fixes
- Fixed import paths in `app/instructor/annotations/page.tsx`
- Fixed import paths in `app/instructor/courses/page.tsx`
- Fixed import paths in `app/instructor/courses/[id]/page.tsx`

## Benefits
- Reduced bundle size by removing 20 unused files
- Eliminated dead code and incomplete refactoring attempts
- Improved maintainability by removing non-functional contexts
- Cleaned up abandoned class-based implementations

## Notes
- All removed hooks and contexts were verified to have no active imports
- Several contexts had no providers in the app layout, making them non-functional
- The presence of class implementations in the context folder suggested incomplete refactoring
- Import paths were corrected for files in the instructor directory
