# Final Single Domain Solution

## Current Implementation
Since Vercel doesn't support true single-domain deployment for multiple Next.js apps, I've implemented a redirect solution:

### What Happens Now:
1. User visits `https://unpuzzle-mono-repo-frontend.vercel.app/instructor`
2. They are redirected to `https://unpuzzle-mono-repo-frontend-v9qa-mceveraj4.vercel.app`
3. The URL changes, but the user reaches the instructor app

### Files Created:
- `/apps/students/app/instructor/page.tsx` - Redirects root instructor route
- `/apps/students/app/instructor/[...slug]/page.tsx` - Redirects all instructor subpaths

## Why True Single Domain is Complex

1. **Next.js Architecture**: Each Next.js app expects to control the entire domain
2. **Asset Conflicts**: Both apps have `/_next` directories that would conflict
3. **Routing Conflicts**: Middleware and API routes would overlap
4. **Build Complexity**: Would require custom build process to merge apps

## Better Alternatives

### Option 1: Subdomains (Recommended)
```
student.unpuzzle.co → Student app
instructor.unpuzzle.co → Instructor app
```

### Option 2: Path-based with Reverse Proxy
Use a service like Cloudflare Workers or AWS CloudFront to:
- Route `/instructor/*` to instructor app
- Route everything else to student app

### Option 3: Monolithic App
Merge both apps into a single Next.js application with:
- Shared components
- Role-based routing
- Single authentication system

## Current Setup Benefits
- Simple to implement
- Works immediately
- No complex configuration
- Each app remains independent

## To Remove the Redirect
If you want to remove this feature:
1. Delete `/apps/students/app/instructor/` directory
2. Remove `"/instructor(.*)"` from public routes in middleware.ts

## Next Steps
1. Consider implementing subdomains for cleaner URLs
2. Or accept the redirect approach as a simple solution
3. For true single-domain, consider merging the apps
